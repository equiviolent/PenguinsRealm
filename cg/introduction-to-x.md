# Introduction to X

#### What is X anyway?

The grandpa of the Unix-like operation systems graphic system often reffered to X, is really one of the oldest widnowing system.

#### Server/Client

The Linux graphic works in the server/client way, a server is a program that coordinates input and output of its client. And it happens over the server display protocol, we'll explain later on what a server display protocol is.

Display server is an important key component of an operation system. whenever you click somewhere on your screen, the screen is the client and who does the job under the hood is the server, (opening an image for example) the client click on it and the server command the hardware to open it.
