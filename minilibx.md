# Minilibx

Here we go, taking a step into the adventure of graphic programming, using our lovely weird library mlx.

#### Minilibx or mlx

Is a simple X-Window interface or API library made for students, is an easy way to create graphical software without any X-Window programming knowledge.

It provides simple window creation, drawing tool, image and basic events management.

We have already discussed what  X is, if you have not read it please make sure to give it a shot [Introduction to X](cg/introduction-to-x.md).

mlx is really simple yet could be overwhelming at the first glance as it's made for student therefore there is not enough documentation, students should take a look at the source code and understand what it can do. though there are a lot of articles and information made thanklessfully by the students all out here, I myself try to put another piece to this puzzle by  explaining the basic functionality of this lovely library of ours, as well trying to link all the available informations I've found on the internet.

I don't know precisely what is the difference between the Macos and Linux versions, but know that mlx uses X11 on Linux, and Opengl on Macos under the hood to do the job.
